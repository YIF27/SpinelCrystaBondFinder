# SpinelCrystalBondFinder

Spinel, with its characteristic chemical formula AB2O4, is a fascinating structure that houses 8 formula units within its unit structure. The unique positioning of its ions – metal ions in tetrahedral and octahedral sites, and oxygen ions in lattice sites – lends it a complex bond architecture that holds clues to its diverse properties. A key determinant of these properties is the cation distribution.

To provide insights into this intricate bond network, our project focuses on the bond analysis of spinels, specifically targeting the Metal-Oxygen-Metal bonds, where two metal ions are bridged by an oxygen. Through this analysis, we not only quantify the various Metal-Oxygen-Metal bonds present in any given spinel system but also elucidate the specific bond types each ion is involved in. This deepens our understanding of the atomic environment of each atom, presenting a comprehensive view of the cation distribution.

With the Spinel Bond Analyzer, you're equipped to delve into the molecular intricacies of spinels, making it an invaluable tool for researchers, chemists, and anyone keen on unraveling the mysteries of this unique structure.
